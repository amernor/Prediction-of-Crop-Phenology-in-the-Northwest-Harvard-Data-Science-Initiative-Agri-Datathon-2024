Hello! This is a project made during the AgriDatathon hosted by the Harvard Data Science Initiative. 
Essentially, this is a project tackling the challenge of connecting spatial and temporal 
data about crop-allocated land within the Northwest using USDA NASS’s CropScape and VegScape 
data processing services. Predicted the 2023 NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) 
of the county of Gem, Idaho using Scikit-learn’s RandomForestsRegressor and other analytical measurements.

Our findings and our code can also be found in this repository. 
Thanks!
